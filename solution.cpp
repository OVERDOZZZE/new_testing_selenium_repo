-> m
-> i
not match, reinitialize window start to next index of m. 
That is "i" from the word "mississipi"

-> i s s i s
-> i s s i p
s and p mismatch

so, reinitialize the window's start
-> s
-> i
not match

reinitialize
-> s
-> i
not match

reinitialize
-> i s s i p
-> i s s i p
this time it was a match!
